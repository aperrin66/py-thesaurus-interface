# nersc-metadata
Metadata conventions for geospatial data at NERSC

This package is in early testing phase. Different solutions that fit the needs of https://github.com/nansencenter/nansat and https://github.com/nansencenter/nansen-cloud are explored in numbered solution-branches, e.g., class-, xml-, json-based solutions, or mixtures of those. These solutions are tested in branches of Nansat develop that are named as "issue120-solution`<num>`".
